# Volcano Tracker
Volcano tracker is a react web application game that tracks all the volcano's on Earth! When a volcano icon is clicked on the map, it will display the ID of the volcano, name/title of the volcano, and the link for more information. 
This was done by using "Google Maps API" and "NASA Open API"!
